  <p>A friend recently turned me to the idea of avoiding using the internet as a means of entertainment. I immediately attached myself to the idea. There are a number of reasons why I find this appealing. 
  <br><br>
  Least importantly, it has the power to make the media I do consume much more impactful to my memory. This is in part due to traditional/physical media (ie. not on-demand) requiring more effort on the consumer to initiate the act of consumption, as well as an overall more limited library of options. Personally, having the media I consume be more impactful and longer-lasting in my memory is very appealing.
  <br><br>
  A more important result of eliminating internet-borne entertainment is the enhancement of the internet as a utility. Considering the internet has been shaped into a wasteland of net-culture (memes) and advertising, having the internet become a useful tool at my disposal rather than another distraction in my life is a welcome change. By changing how I use the internet, far-reaching services such as Google (Search, Ad-Sense, etc.) should notice my usage change and begin to change how it is presented to me, tailoring it more to my utilitarian needs rather than entertainment.
  <br><br>
  At this point, the ultimate outcome for me is a reduced reliance on the internet as a need to get by in my day. Downtime is often Internet Time for me, which amounts to scrolling through news headlines I don't care about or revisiting homepages I've already visited multiple times that day (or that minute) just to pass the time. Usually my Internet Time is more of a "fidget" activity than it is a mentally stimulating one. I see this as a very negative way to spend my time. Outside of the moment, I would much rather close my eyes and think about, well, <i>anything</i> than fidget my way through the internet.
