  <h1>My Harem of Imaginary Girlfriends Is Turning On Me!</h1>
  <img style="border:1px dashed black;" src="./imgs/my-harem-of-imaginary-girlfriends.png">
  <p style="width:470px;">Eri. Nako. Azusa. My three lovely girlfriends. We spend every waking minute together. Hell, we spend every sleeping minute together, too! They're all madly in love with me, but something isn't quite right. Azusa, why won't you let me hold you in my arms while we sleep? Eri, you didn't make a bentou for me today? Nako, can't you give me at least one kiss? None of my girlfriends are acting like their usual selves. Oh, and, by the way, did I mention they all exist inside my head?
