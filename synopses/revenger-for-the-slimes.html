  <img style="border:1px dashed black;" src="./imgs/revenger-for-the-slimes.png">
  <p style="width:470px;">Gooey Shitataro is the Slime Lord. After completing thousands of quests defeating slimes, Gooey has developed a liking for the squishy, low-level creatures. Now, Gooey fights FOR them, and seeks to avenge the slimes who have been wrongfully slayed by adventurers. Gooey and his squishy squad of slime companions march towards justice for all slime-kind! But will the high level warriors of their kingdom take them seriously, or will they become the laughing stock of the world?
