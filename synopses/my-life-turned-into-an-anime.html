  <h1>My Life Turned Into An Anime... And I'm the Main Character!!</h1>
  <img style="border:1px dashed black;" src="./imgs/my-life-turned-into-an-anime.png">
  <p style="width:470px;">Kay is an average American high schooler who also happens to be a massive otaku. One day, after falling asleep watching his favorite school life anime, he wakes to find his whole world cel-shaded! Kay, now Kei-san, discovers he was transported into a school life anime, complete with subtitles and a remote that can pause, fast-forward, and rewind everything around him. Will Kei-san be able to assimilate into this new world, or will his knowledge of anime get him into more trouble than it's worth?
