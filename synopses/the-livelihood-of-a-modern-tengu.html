  <h1>The Livelihood of A Modern Tengu and His Extra Long Flower</h1>
  <img style="border:1px dashed black;" src="./imgs/the_livelihood_of_a_modern_tengu.png">
  <p style="width:470px;">For centuries, Tengu have served as protective spirites for the Mountains in Japan. But can you really expect a Tengu to stay stuck in the mountains for so long? The young Tengu named Nagibou has abandoned his post guarding a small mountain in central Japan, opting instead for a life in the great city of Tokyo. Adjusting to the concrete jungle isn't without its challenges, but Nagibou's kind soul and honest heart quickly make him popular among the cityfolk as he works to become the first Guardian Tengu of Tokyo!
