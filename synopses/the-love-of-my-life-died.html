  <h1>The Love of My Life Died Before I Could Confess To Her</h1>
  <img style="border:1px dashed black;" src="./imgs/the-love-of-my-life-died.png">
  <p style="width:470px;">Himeko Komatsu is the love of my life. We have been in the same class since grade 1, and I've loved her since I first saw her. She's graceful, beautiful, intelligent and kind. The thing is, I've never talked to her, and the only one who knows of my love is the slightly awkward and strange Aimi Enomoto. But finally, after 7 years of admiring her from afar, I've decided to confess to her. However, she was suddenly killed in an accident, and now the only one who can console me is the Aimi. It really can't get any worse than this.
