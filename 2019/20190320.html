  <br>
  <p>I wonder if it is a bad thing to think back so often to myself in the past. It, of course, isn't inherently a bad thing. Thinking about your past is, in most cases, normal. I don't think I deviate from what would be considered normal hindsight, but I do wonder what it does for me in the present.
  <br>
  Most frequently, I think back on what I would consider to be hard times in my life - nothing especially noteworthy, just highly emotional periods of time or events. I could argue that there are things to learn from these times. After all, it's not abnormal to come out of difficult situations with a positive outlook. However, I feel like this just isn't the case for me.
  <br>
  I do believe that I've become a better individual as a result of the events I'm referring to. There is no denying that. Had they not happened, I don't think I'd have the perspective one life that I have now.
