  <h1>20190320</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I wonder if it is a bad thing to think back so often to myself in the past. It, of course, isn't inherently a bad thing. Thinking about your past is, in most cases, normal. I don't think I deviate from what would be considered normal hindsight, but I do wonder what it does for me in the present.
  <br>
  Most frequently, I think back on what I would consider to be hard times in my life - nothing especially noteworthy, just highly emotional periods of time or events. I could argue that there are things to learn from these times. After all, it's not abnormal to come out of difficult situations with a positive outlook. However, I feel like this just isn't the case for me.
  <br>
  I do believe that I've become a better individual as a result of the events I'm referring to. There is no denying that. Had they not happened, I don't think I'd have the perspective on life that I have now. But I don't look back on that time positively. It was a very negative time, and I only feel negativity towards myself and the others involved at the time. But I continue to look back nonetheless. Dwelling on such negativity seems like it can't be a good thing.
  <br>
  So now I wonder: can negativity be positive? I do feel a sort of twisted satisfaction as I think about those events. It's not something I can trace to a root. The feeling isn't a lingering sense of superiority I had at the time, nor is it a sense of nascent superiority for having grown away from those feelings. Perhaps it is nostalgia, but I reject that idea on principle and all but refuse to humor it. 
  <br>
  Then what can explain the positive emotional response I have to that time in my life? All that is left for me to consider is a karmic balance, of sorts. Is it possible that I have been so thoroughly drained of emotional negativity that nothing is left but the inverse? It makes me wonder, as time goes on, how will I see today when it is yesterday?
