  <h1>20190401</h1>
  <p>I used to be into the idea of being punk. Not necessarily a punk in terms of reputation, but in ideology. Despite that, it's not like I really cared about the punk movement. I was into the fashion, to be honest. But like any relationship, it usually starts with physical attraction and builds from there. It was the same in this case. It seemed cool, rebellious and edgy. I wanted to be that. But anarchy and anti-establishment wasn't really anything I cared about all that much. It all seemed cool in concept, for some reason, but hell, I was only just a teenager. How could I have cared about any of that at 14? 
  <br><br>
  So I grew my hair long, wore clothes that were out of the ordinary, skateboarded and listened to rock music. It was what I was supposed to do as a wannabe punk. I'll admit it, I was a poser. In hindsight, there was a part of me that wasn't posing, but for the most part I'll be real and admit I was just a poser. I wanted people to <i>think</i> I was a punk, and that was my main motivation. I'm not sure if it worked all that well. I bounced around styles of music and clothing and movements as my life moved forward. Punk to emo. Emo to hipster. I was riding the bleeding edge of trends. Throughout it all, I still felt like a punk no matter what they called the trend.
  <br><br>
  It was a bit weird to think back on that. I still want to be a punk. I still feel like one. But I know I was reaching when I was younger. And I think I knew it back then. I <i>felt</i> like a punk, but I knew the clothes and the attitude was fraudulent. I liked the way I looked, and I felt like I was different, but it felt forced. Because it <i>was</i> forced. I was trying to convince people I was something I wasn't. In a way I was trying to convince myself too. I wasn't hardcore or anything like that. I just wanted myself and everyone else to think that I was the same as the hardcore people I looked up to. In reality, I was a soft emo kid that was a decent liar. I mean, I was a Christian, too. How many God-fearing anarchists do you know? 
  <br><br>
  Religion is probably what attracted me to the punk movement in the first place. I was a Christian, but I didn't like how it was represented. I didn't fall in line with the prim and proper face of christianity, so I tended to feel a bit like an outsider. What people would imagine a Christian to look and act like wasn't me. I felt like there was something about myself that others didn't understand. In short, I just felt different, and punk <i>looked</i> different. And that's the origin story, I guess.
  <br><br>
  Eventually, the trend following and desire to be perceived as different faded from my motivations. Too many people were catching on to the trends and I didn't feel good about it anymore. I sort of retreated into myself. I dressed pretty inconspicuously and kept to myself more. Around this time I cranked up the introspection and self-criticism. I started questioning why I did this or that. Why did I care about xyz? That kind of thing. I started being more honest with myself and I started to learn who I really was. That clarity brought a desire for more self-care, and I ended up skateboarding again as a way to get some physical activity in my week. The skateboarding revived some old rock music I liked when I was a kid, and got me thinking about being a punk again.
  <br><br>
  Pretty quickly, old habits made me want to pursue that punk persona again. Thankfully, I was equipped with a more critical view of myself and I was able to think through everything. Why did I want to be a punk? I asked myself this. The answer I came to was that individuality was important to me, and punk sort of exudes individuality. But I knew playing the punk was dishonest. I wasn't a torn denim vest kind of guy, no matter how much I wanted to be. So I asked myself if I really cared about people <i>seeing me as an individual</i>. Was the way I presented myself good enough? After all it <i>was</i> me. And my beliefs - were they not enough? The reality was that I was already an individual. 
  <br><br>
  My principles, how few they are at this point, are strong, and getting stronger. I like who I am and I don't need to follow any formula to feel like a punk. Punks stand for what they believe in and won't bend to the pressure of others if they don't agree. And that's how I feel. I don't need to be anyone other than myself to be a punk. In fact, myself is <i>exactly</i> who I need to be to be a punk. And if you want to disagree, then fuck you. \m/
