  <h1>20190523</h1>
  <p>Sometimes I get in the mood to just write. Or, similarly, I'll sometimes have the urge to sit down and type at a keyboard. Usually both are the same end-result, but the motivations are different. At the moment, it happens to be a mixture of the two. I want to wring out some creative buildup in my head, while at the same time I want the tactile experience of typing on a keyboard. 
<br><br>
I've started a new section of 555000 that consists of synopses of non-existant manga/anime/light novels that I've come up with. I've done similar exercises in the past. As far back as high school, I done similar things. I used to write exerpts from stories that didn't exist. However, with these new synopses, I'm accompanying them with cover illustrations I've created. 
<br><br>
The illustrations are nothing special, really. To be honest, they're of quite poor quality, but that doesn't really bother me. After all, I'm using MS Paint to create them, and my only input method is a standard computer mouse. Nevertheless, it's a good exercise for me to practice illustration. I can experiment with different methods and styles without really caring about whether or not it turns out well.
<br><br>
All in all, a 'bad' end result is just as good for me as a 'good' one. I can appreciate what I've done, and I have a good time doing it, which is what's most important.
<br><br>
If you'd like to check them out, head over to the <a href="http://555000.info/2019/20190523.html>Synopses page</a> and browse around.
