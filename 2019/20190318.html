  <h1>20190318</h1>
  <p>It seems common now for the majority of publications online to be focused on pop-culture media. I realize this observation could just be the result of my own personal biases leading me toward those things (I'm currently trying to shed the habit of living a life around media consumption), but the result of algorithms utilizing your own personal interests and history to push you further into those biases makes it difficult to find what lies out side of said biases. So, for better or worse, I'm going to accept this possibility and do my best to work within its confines.
  <br><br>
  To get straight to the point, I want to keep a log of thoughts in writing on the web. Admittedly, I don't have a solid concept of what it is I actually want to write about. My previously mentioned biases end up naturally leading me toward writing about pop-culture media, which I want to avoid doing. My reason for avoiding that is due to my belief that there is already too much focus on pop-culture media and the responses of enthusiasts publications surrounding that interest sphere.
  <br><br>
  So, my goal now is to find out what it is I will focus my writings on. To do that, I think I need to understand what it is I want to accomplish with keeping these logs.
  <br><br>
  First and foremost in my mind, in my current state, I simply want to have a legacy of some sort - nothing grand or spectacular, nor noteworthy. I just want something that can be looked back on.
  <br><br>
  Secondly (and probably most importantly), I see the logs as a good opportunity for personal growth. This seems like the most reasonable direction to take my writings, as I often will have conversations in my head with myself regarding my beliefs and thoughts on anything and everything. Refining these conversations into written essays should serve well for shaping myself and helping me figure out who I am and what I believe in.
  <br><br>
  Hopefully, if these logs are seen by others, they will serve to encourage others to seek personal growth from within themselves.</p>
