  <h1>20190506</h1>
  <p>For a few years, I didn't listen to music. A song here and there, maybe, but that was few and far between. I may have chosen to listen to a few songs in a day only once over the course of several months. Sure, there was music playing in the background, or I would ride in someone else's car and they would play music, but I myself did not choose play it.
  <br>
  <br>
  For a while, the habit of not listening to music was something I practiced with a certain amount of pride. The perception developed in my mind that everyone seemed to be so proud of their musical tastes as something that individualized themselves from others. When I had come to that conclusion, I thought about how strange it was that people would find their individuality in something that was so universal. An individual wouldn't stand out with music, because music doesn't stand out in and of itself, I thought. So, I abandoned the medium in an effort to develop my own individuality.

  After retreating from music, I didn't live my life in silence. I regularly tuned into weekly podcasts to fill the air, and often found myself re-listening to some of my favorite episodes. However, there were plenty of situations where I didn't bother to fill the air with any noise, and instead used that time to think. This is when I started down the path of frequent introspection. I began to discover a lot about myself. It wasn't a conscious effort to do this, to be honest. Despite wanting to establish my individuality, I didn't ever intend to come to know more about myself as a means to that end. Things natually moved in that direction though, and I don't think I ever would have neared my desired end if I hadn't started examining myself.
  <br>
  <br>
  I came to find that I relied too much on media in general as a identifier for myself. Yes, I had abandoned music, but replacing music with any other medium would nullify my efforts. This conclusion took a long time to arrive at. I was frequently crutching my identity on some form of media - movies, anime, podcasts, video games... It was all just more of the same. And it's no surprise, either. American culture is so heavily inundated with media that it's hard to communicate with anyone outside of that realm. Media has become the Great American Pastime. It's our number one export. Culture is bought and sold, but I didn't want to be a product. This isn't to say that I've abandoned media altogether. In fact, I eventually came back around to listening to music. But now I can consume with intention, not out of habit.

  <br>
  What I'm trying to get at is that I discovered that what matters most to me is what matters to me. To be a little clearer, what I care about in my life are the things that I am drawn to on a more personal level. Media consumption as a habit was a disruptive force for my spirit. I began to care too much about knowing and loving and understanding and appreciating things more than others did that I stopped caring about whether or not I truly knew, loved, understood, or appreciated anything. Others' perception of me was more important than the real me. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I think it's important to have a connection to the things you consume. My connection to everything in my life is what makes me unique.
