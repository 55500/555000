  <p>There is a fine line between selflessness and self loathing. Behind the scenes, each comes from a very distinctly different place. But, in practice, in the right context, they effectively are exactly the same. This is a theory that has proven true for me, and has benefited me greatly as a result. 
  <br><br>
  In general, I would describe myself as being nearly an optimist. This behavior stems from my tendency to avoid conflict whenever possible. Now, I say 'nearly an optimist' because I don't practice true optimism. Rather, in situations of uncertainty, I typically exhibit a willingness to concede to positivity. For example, if someone commits an act that slights me in some way, I cannot know what the intent behind their actions were, therefor I choose to accept that the slight against me in a positive light (eg. it was unintentional, or, at the very least, deserved in some way). This, in part, has to do with self-loathing nature.
  <br><br>
  To start, I'll say that I don't like using the term 'self-loathing' to describe myself, as it's very dramatic, which seems inaccurate to me. "Self-deprecation" seems more accurate, but its more frequent use as a form of comedy makes it less appealing. So, for lack of a better alternative, I will use 'self-loathing'. To put it briefly, what I mean by 'self-loathing' is the dismissal of myself in all regards as being insignificant, especially (possibly specifically) when compared to others. 
  <br><br>
  When combining my near-optimism with my self-loathing tendencies, the result is something that resembles selflessness.  I'm willing to kneel to others' ideas, opinions and priorities because I don't see my own as having any value. If I make a mistake on behalf of someone else, I will take responsibility for it, as I believe the mistake was rooted in my execution rather than the direction I was following. There are plenty of examples I could go through. Ultimately, it all boils down to that near-optimism and self-loathing (with a sprinkle of seemingly ever-present, untraceable guilt) which prioritizes myself below others as a result.
  <br><br>
  That last part is the most important. See, the big difference between selflessness and self-loathing is how you contextualize the priorities. For me, I am below everyone else. For someone who is truly selfless, others are above them. It's a subtle difference, but can show in big ways.
  <br><br>
  This isn't all to say I'm a good person. It's the opposite. I'm actually very selfish. I enjoy feelings of self-pity, and simply found that I can maintain those feelings without impeding on others' lives by decreasing my own value in myself. It's more or less a classic example voluntary martyrdom, minus all of the respectable and redeeming factors.
  <br><br>
  I will say, however, that this is a very dangerous mindset to be in. It can easily breed spite towards others. This is why the two factors of self-loathing and near-optimism are an important balance. If a person reaches this mindset while lacking honesty and positivity, things can certainly turn for the worst. Instead of placing yourself below others (or others above yourself), you will end up feeling as though you deserve to be above others, but are placed below others by some external factor. Avoid this at all costs.
  <br><br>
  By no means do I encourage anyone to adopt this lifestyle. I think it's healthy for people to value themselves. Selflessness should be the goal, not this bastardization I'm writing about. Aim high, but if you miss the mark, at least accept that fact and move forward with positivity.</p>
