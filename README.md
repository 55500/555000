# 555000.info
555000 is a personal journal.

## Content Description
The writings I publish here are strictly based on personal biases and opinions. Nothing written attempts to be rendered as fact. Many details may be factually incorrect or inaccurately represent my opinion. It is difficult to convey my thoughts perfectly, so expect to find inconsistencies. I will do my best to update and correct inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and mistakes when necessary. If you notice any issues in my writing, please feel free to [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/55500/555000.info/issues).

I am also trying to write in a way that represents my actual voice accurately, so you will probably see sub-par grammar and diction as a result. I most likely won't be correcting any of that, because I think it better reflects who I am at the time of writing. This being a record of my self and my thoughts, I want to keep things as accurately reflective as I can. 

## Design Philosophy
Functionality is prioritized over fashion. The simplicity and utility of classic HTML index directories inspired the visual design (or lack thereof) of 555000. The site is coded to display text with your browser's default monospace font by using the `<tt>` tag. This not only serves to maximize compatibility by minimizing customization, but also adds a cool, clinical look to each page.
