# 555000.info
555000 is a personal journal.

## Design Philosophy
Functionality is prioritized over fashion. The simplicity and utility of classic HTML index directories inspired the simplicity and basic function of 555000.

## Content Direction
The writings published here are strictly based on personal biases and opinions. Nothing written attempts to be rendered as fact. Many details may be inaccurate, factually and personally. It is difficult to convey one's own thoughts perfectly, so expect inconsistency to be present. I will do my best to update and correct inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and mistakes as I see fit. If you notice any issues in the writings, please feel free to [submit an Issue on the git repository](https://github.com/555000/555000.info/issues).
