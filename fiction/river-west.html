<i>Ping!</i><br>
River always kept a coin in his pocket for times like this.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
Times when he had time to kill.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
River pulled a coin from his pocket, balanced it on his first knuckle, and flicked it into the air with his thumb.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
River grabbed the coin as it fell back down.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
The coin clapped against River's palm when he caught it.<br>
<i>Pak!</i><br>
River was posted outside of a local convenience store. He leaned against the wall next to a broken pay phone. Between tosses, he looked up at the sky. The sun was on its way down, but there wasn't any sign of it getting dark yet. He wondered what time it was, but dismissed the question just as soon as he'd thought it. River had nowhere to be, after all.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
River spent a lot of time like this. He had a lot of time to kill. <br>
"Hey River! Fancy seeing you here."<br>
Lotte Hadley. She was from his school, one class below him. Lotte was a cute girl. She chewed bubble gum and wore pleated skirts.<br>
"You still comin' out here and wastin' your life away?"<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
River said he didn't know what to say.<br>
"Well, you're always out here flippin' coins and doin' nothin'." Lotte crossed her arms and tapped her foot.<br>
River said when there's nothing to do, what other choice do you have?<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
"Maybe you should open a savings account. Put all that change you've got in there, instead of throwin' it around."<br>
River said it ain't worth saving.<br>
Lotte uncrossed her arms and put her hands on her hips. <br>
"Well, if you ain't gonna save it, then maybe you oughta buy me somethin' nice!" she winked and pushed her chest out. <br>
River said it ain't enough to buy nothin'.<br>
"Jeez," Lotte sighed, "If it ain't worth savin' and it ain't worth spendin', then why don't ya just throw it away?" Lotte waited it a beat. "Oh, I see. Must be some kinda treasure. A lucky coin or somethin'." Lotte smiled real big. Proud of herself.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
River said there ain't nothin' lucky about it. River said it ain't special neither.<br>
Lotte's smile disappeared. She stared at River in disbelief and let her jaw hang slack. River could see the bubble gum in the back of her mouth. He wondered what flavor it was. <br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
Lotte finally straighted up. River kept flipping the coin.<br>
"You know what, River?" She walked up to him and quickly snatched the coin out of the air.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
River stared at her, unmoved.<br>
"If it ain't worth nothin' to you, why don't I just take this dumb thing for myself?" Lotte held the coin above her head. Her face was serious.<br>
River said just because it ain't worth much don't mean it ain't worth nothin'.<br>
Lotte squinted her eyes at River. She turned around and walked five steps away, then turned back to River.<br>
"I don't get you, River."<br>
Lotte flicked the coin back to him.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
River said there ain't much to get.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
Lotte turned away and kept walking. Her pleated skirt swayed back and forth with each step. Lotte was a cute girl.<br>
River looked at the coin in his hand. It really wasn't worth much. Couldn't even buy a piece of bubble gum with it.<br>
<i>Ping!</i><br>
<i>Pak!</i><br>
River turned to the broken pay phone next to him. The coin sounded heavy when he dropped it in the slot.<br>
<i>Plunk!</i><br>
